❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a - b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the scope of the `sum` function, nor are
they passed as arguments. This will lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
* ❌ **Incorrect Operation:** The function name suggests summation, but the code performs subtraction (`a - b`).
* ❌ **Missing Arguments:** A sum function should accept arguments to add together.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔️ **Defined Arguments:** The function now accepts `a` and `b` as arguments, making its behavior predictable and
reusable.
* ✔️ **Correct Operation:** The function now performs addition (`a + b`), aligning with its name and expected
functionality.
* ✔️ **Clear Scope:** The function operates on the provided arguments, ensuring it doesn't rely on external, potentially
undefined variables.

Final Notes:

This revised code addresses the issues of undeclared variables and incorrect operation. It takes two arguments `a` and
`b` and returns their sum, aligning with the function's intended purpose. This makes the code more robust, readable, and
maintainable. Remember to always declare variables and ensure functions perform the intended operations.
